# hello-world
About me:
  - Bachelors degrees in physics and math
  - Experienced in Windows and Linux administration
  - Took java I, II, III in college for the extra challenge
  - Surprisingly passionate about nanoscale imaging techniques (STM, SEM, AFM, FIB, etc.)
  - Interned at NIST and modeled thin-film photovoltaics to optimize effeciency in matlab
  - Interned at WVU and searched for new exciton energy states in thin-film semiconductors (with a really big laser)
  - Captivated by Riemann's hypothesis and other unsolved math problems
  - Here to learn and share with the community
